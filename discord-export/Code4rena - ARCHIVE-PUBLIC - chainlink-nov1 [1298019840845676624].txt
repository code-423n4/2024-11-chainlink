üëã Hello and welcome to the audit channel for the **$235,000 in USDC Chainlink** audit!

üìÜ Audit opens Friday, 01 November 2024 20:00 (20:00 UTC) and runs through Monday, 25 November 2024 20:00 (20:00 UTC) (24 days).

Please give a warm welcome to the Chainlink team, particularly @Ryan | Chainlink, @Rens | Chainlink Labs, @Suryansh | Chainlink Labs, @Josh | Chainlink Labs and @Evaldas | Chainlink Labs who will be available for questions either here in the channel or via a PRIVATE thread in the CET timezone primarily (with some US coverage). 

ü§ñ¬†**Documentation bot assistance:** For general questions about the codebase, give our documentation bot a try, by tagging `@Docs Wolf` in any thread (private or public) and asking your question. The bot will make its best attempt to answer based on the codebase and documentation, and link you to relevant resources.  

We'll be posting relevant links, documentation, etc. here, so if you intend to participate in this audit, consider enabling notifications for this channel. üê∫ ‚è∞

- `NOTE: not all exotic chains have been taking into consideration when designing CCIP. There will inevitably be chains that won't work. Findings are judged on how realistic it would be for CCIP to expand to that chain.`

Which exotic, non-EVM chains have been taking into consideration when designing CCIP(other than Solana) & what metric will be used to judge how realistic it is for CCIP to expand to that chain?


[11/03/2024 09:53] cllccip
This is mostly to guard against people coming up with chains with zero volume/market cap that just happen to have some large change we cannot accommodate with the current code. Market cap is not an ideal predictor but it might be the best we have. Anything in the top 100 with a functional smart contract system should be possible. Probably also the top 200 but I have not explicitly checked those chains.

Has the introduction of blobs in L2's been considered in `_getDataAvailabilityCost` computations? I'm curious as [Fjord upgrade in OP](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/transactions/fees#fjord), for example particulary changes a lot txn fee estimation. I'm just wondering if this is a known issue that is addressed by changing configurations.


[11/04/2024 17:50] ryanrhall
We are aware of the Fjord upgrade! Our system is flexible enough that we can usually handle various hard-forks with simple config changes. See [config struct here](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/bfd9a3ffe11484f3dc413bb77a709f2c4bb281b0/contracts/src/v0.8/ccip/FeeQuoter.sol#L92:L111). FWIW we don't have to perfectly model the chain's tx fee model and in most cases we're happy just to simplify and overestimate. As long as it's not subject to abuse!

Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avax, Base, BSC, Optimism, Polygon, zkSync, Other any and all EVM chains. Some chains require special configs (like setting OOO to be enforced). There is no guarantee that every chain that claims to be EVM is supported by the current contracts.

Even though we increased the max number of nodes from 32 to 256, that does *not* mean we will suddenly increase the number of signers significantly. We currently require 6 signatures (f+1, f = 5, nodes = 16, nodes = 3f+1), this will not suddenly grow to be >32 (which would not fit in the `v` section of the signatures). This would be prohibitively expensive as each sig costs ~7.2k gas. Therefore the max range of the `v`s is not a concern

[11/25/2024 07:23] cllccip
There will be a period where both systems would operate at the same time. There is always one version active per lane though. So e.g. lanes to/from chain X already run 1.6 but others still run 1.5.

My question is, what if a warden submits an issue as a low and a medium(changing the structure and words in both reports), how will that be handled or judged?

[11/25/2024 09:34] eme0242
Title: Warden can escape penalty for incorrect risk categorization

Severity: HIGH

Impact: Warden will get rewards that he should not be elligible for

POC: Mainnet will be live in 9 hrs, unexploitable until then

Vulnerability details: Due to the rule in contest readme that "High- or Medium-risk submissions downgraded to Low-risk (QA)) will be ineligible for awards.
Upgrading a Low-risk finding from a QA report to a Medium- or High-risk finding is not supported.", a warden can submit same issue as both a low and a medium(using different phrasing).
If the correct severity is low/medium, one of his reports becomes valid, while the other invalid.
Two wardens can collab to make it untraceable to a single warden.

Recommendation: Please remove the ruleü•π

So I have a question about high or downgraded grading:

"
High- or Medium-risk submissions downgraded to Low-risk (QA)) will be ineligible for awards.
Upgrading a Low-risk finding from a QA report to a Medium- or High-risk finding is not supported."


So does this mean, if I find a medium severity but the warden thinks its a high vulnerability I will get paid for a medium severity? or not get paid at all?

Im sure this makes alot of people hesitant on participating in contests


[01/03/2025 16:47] cloudellie
If you submit a finding as a Medium and it is upgraded to High, the finding will be awarded as a High.


[01/03/2025 16:49] cloudellie
That note applies to findings that are either:
- submitted as High/Medium but downgraded to Low, or
- submitted as Low (i.e. as part of a QA report), but another warden reported the same issue as a High or Medium and it was judged to be valid (i.e. the Low submission will not be upgraded and marked as a duplicate of the HM finding).

Hi did PJQA reports get reviewed some are still marked as needs review?


[01/06/2025 10:15] cloudellie
Can you clarify what you mean by "PJQA reports"? 

"Needs review" usually refers to customer input, which is optional -- but the validator and judge review every QA report.


[01/06/2025 10:20] cheatc0d3
Oh I meant reports that wardens raised disputes during pjqa ..for example my reports f87 and f86 shows needs triage and needs review but marked invalid on judge end..was decision final that these are invalid?

If you don't see your username among the list of award recipients, then your submission was not accepted for awarding. 

As noted in the award announcement:

With most C4 audits, wardens can view discussion on their submissions when the report is made public, but for this audit all submissions are being kept private.
